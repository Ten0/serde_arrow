**Warning:** this package is in an experiment at the moment.

[Arrow][arrow] is a powerful library to work with data frame like structures.
The surrounding ecosystem includes a rich set of libraries, ranging from data
frames via [Polars][polars] to query engines via [DataFusion][datafusion].
However, it's API due to the statically typed nature of Rust can be at times
cumbersome to use directly. This package, `serde_arrow`, tries to bridge this
gap by offering a simple way to convert Rust objects into Arrow objects and vice
versa.  `serde_arrow` relies on the [Serde](https://serde.rs) package to
interpret Rust objects. Therefore, adding support for `serde_arrow` to custom
types is as easy as using Serde's derive macros. 

See the [implementation notes](serde_arrow/Implementation.md) for details on how
it is implemented. This package is optimized for ease of use, not performance.

## Example

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Example {
    a: f32,
    b: i32,
}

let examples = vec![
    Example { a: 1.0, b: 1 },
    Example { a: 2.0, b: 2 },
];

// Detect the schema from the supplied data
use serde_arrow::Schema;
let schema = Schema::from_records(&examples)?;

// Write the records into an IPC file
let out  = File::create("examples.arrow")?;
serde_arrow::to_ipc_writer(out, &examples, &schema)?;

// NOTE: the records can also be converted into a RecordBatch. The RecordBatch
// can then be used to convert it into a polars DataFrame or written to parquet.
//
// let batch = serde_arrow::to_record_batch(&examples, schema)?;
```

The written file can now be read in Python via

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.read_feather("examples.arrow")
```
