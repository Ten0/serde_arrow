**Warning:** this package is in an experiment at the moment.

The arrow in-memory format is a powerful way to work with data frame like
structures. The surrounding ecosystem includes a rich set of libraries, ranging
from data frames via [Polars][polars] to query engines via
[DataFusion][datafusion]. However, the API of the underlying Rust crates can be
at times cumbersome to use due to the statically typed nature of Rust.

`serde_arrow`, offers a simple way to convert Rust objects into Arrow arrays and
back.  `serde_arrow` relies on the [Serde](https://serde.rs) package to
interpret Rust objects. Therefore, adding support for `serde_arrow` to custom
types is as easy as using Serde's derive macros.

In the Rust ecosystem there are two competing implementations of the arrow
in-memory format. `serde_arrow` supports both [`arrow`][arrow] and
[`arrow2`][arrow2] for schema tracing, serialization from Rust structs to
arrays, and deserialization from arrays to Rust structs.

## Example

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Item {
    a: f32,
    b: i32,
    point: Point,
}

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Point(f32, f32);

let items = vec![
    Item { a: 1.0, b: 1, point: Point(0.0, 1.0) },
    Item { a: 2.0, b: 2, point: Point(2.0, 3.0) },
    // ...
];

// detect the field types and convert the items to arrays
use serde_arrow::arrow2::{serialize_into_fields, serialize_into_arrays};

let fields = serialize_into_fields(&items, TracingOptions::default())?;
let arrays = serialize_into_arrays(&fields, &items)?;
```

These arrays can now be written to disk using the helper method defined in the
[arrow2 guide][arrow2-guide]. For parquet:

```rust,ignore
use arrow2::{chunk::Chunk, datatypes::Schema};

// see https://jorgecarleitao.github.io/arrow2/io/parquet_write.html
write_chunk(
    "example.pq",
    Schema::from(fields),
    Chunk::new(arrays),
)?;
```

The written file can now be read in Python via

```python
# using polars
import polars as pl
pl.read_parquet("example.pq")

# using pandas
import pandas as pd
pd.read_parquet("example.pq")
```

## Related packages & Performance

- [`arrow`][arrow]: the JSON component of the official Arrow package supports
   serializing objects that support serialize via the [RawDecoder][raw-decoder]
   object. It supports primitives types, structs and lists
- [`arrow2-convert`][arrow2-convert]: adds derive macros to convert objects from
  and to arrow2 arrays. It supports primitive types, structs, lists, and
  chrono's date time types. Enum support is experimental according to the
  Readme. If performance is the main objective, `arrow2-convert` is a good
  choice as it has no or minimal overhead over building the arrays manually.

[arrow2-convert]: https://github.com/DataEngineeringLabs/arrow2-convert

The different implementation have the following performance differences, when
compared to arrow2-convert:

## Development

All common tasks are bundled in the `x.py` script:

```bash
# format the code and run tests
python x.py precommit
```

Run `python x.py --help` for details. The script only uses standard Python
modules can can be run without installing further packages.
